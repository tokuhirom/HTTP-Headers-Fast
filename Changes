        - Strip out empty lines separated by CRLF.(markstos)
            Before the patch, an embedded CRLF would be allowed through with a
            space added after it. This is spec-compliant but appears not to be
            the intent, based on the regex to remove empty lines in headers.  If
            a client accepted "CRLF\sCRLF\s" as a valid header end, then a CRLF
            injection attack would have been possible.
            (This patch was ported from the HTTP::Headers git repo. )

            The possiblity of the former behavior exploitably seems particular small
    . Apache
            won't even send out header that a space between the two required CRLFs.
